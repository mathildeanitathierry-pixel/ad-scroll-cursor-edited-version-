# Quick Start Commands

After installing Node.js/npm, copy and paste these commands one by one:

## Step 1: Navigate to your project
```bash
cd /Users/mathildeanitathierry/Desktop/adscroll-rewards-main
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

(This will take a minute or two - it's downloading all the packages your project needs)

## Step 3: Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What you'll see:

After running `npm run dev`, you should see something like:
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:8080/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8080**

## To stop the server:
Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal

## If you get errors:

- **"command not found"**: Restart your terminal after installing Node.js
- **"permission denied"**: Try: `sudo npm install` (but usually not needed)
- **"EACCES" errors**: You may need to fix npm permissions (rare)
